# This Makefile is used to build and execute the tools, in particular
# the 'build' tool which is responsible for reading the source code and
# determining what needs to be done to build the images.
#
# If you are looking at how to build the images, then just run 'make',
# and it should take care of it.
#
# If you are looking at changing the build process, then this isn't
# probably the right place. Look at 'tools/src/ovirt/cmd/build/build.go'
# instead, as that is the starting point for the main build process.

# In order to use things like 'pushd' we need to explicitly set 'bash' as the
# shell, as in some enviroments (Travis CI, for example) the default shell is
# plain 'sh':
SHELL=/bin/bash

# The root of the Go source code:
ROOT=$(PWD)/tools

# Locations of the Go and Glide binaries:
GO_BINARY=go
GLIDE_BINARY=$(ROOT)/bin/glide

# Location of the Glide project:
GLIDE_PROJECT=$(shell find tools/src -name glide.yaml -print -quit)

# Location of the generated tool:
TOOL_BINARY=$(ROOT)/bin/ovc

# Install Glide if necessary:
$(GLIDE_BINARY):
	mkdir -p `dirname $(GLIDE_BINARY)`
	GOPATH="$(ROOT)"; \
	export GOPATH; \
	PATH="$(ROOT)/bin:$${PATH}"; \
	export PATH; \
	curl https://glide.sh/get | sh

# The sources of the tool are the .go files, but also the image
# specifications and the OpenShift manifests, as they are embedded
# within the binary:
TOOL_SOURCES=\
	project.conf \
	$(shell find tools/src -type f -name '*.go') \
	$(shell find image-specifications -type f) \
	$(shell find os-manifests -type f) \
	$(NULL)

# Rule to build the tool from its source code:
$(TOOL_BINARY): $(GLIDE_BINARY) $(TOOL_SOURCES)
	GOPATH="$(ROOT)"; \
	export GOPATH; \
	pushd $$(dirname $(GLIDE_PROJECT)); \
		$(GLIDE_BINARY) install && \
		$(GO_BINARY) generate && \
		$(GO_BINARY) build -o $@ *.go || \
		exit 1; \
	popd \
