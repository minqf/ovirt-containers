# This Makefile is used to build and execute the tools, in particular
# the 'build' tool which is responsible for reading the source code and
# determining what needs to be done to build the images.
#
# If you are looking at how to build the images, then just run 'make',
# and it should take care of it.
#
# If you are looking at changing the build process, then this isn't
# probably the right place. Look at 'tools/src/ovirt/cmd/build/build.go'
# instead, as that is the starting point for the main build process.
